- Hello, I’m @WireHallMedic
- I'm currently finishing my BS in CS in Oregon, United States.
- I'm currently employed as a software engineer at a major telecom company. I like it; I get to fix things, and don't have to take my work home with me.
- My main area of interest is game development, particularly roguelike dev.
- I can be reached at MichaelWidler@Yahoo.com
