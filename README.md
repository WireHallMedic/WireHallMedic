- Hello, I’m @WireHallMedic
- I live Oregon, United States, with my spouse, offspring, and dogs.
- I'm currently employed as a software engineer at a major telecom company. I like it; I get to fix things, and don't have to take my work home with me. Well, I'm remote these days, but you know what I mean.
- My main area of interest is game development, particularly roguelike dev. I have no desire to go beyond hobbyist with as a game dev.
- I can be reached at MichaelWidler@Yahoo.com
